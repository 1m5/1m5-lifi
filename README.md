# 1m5-lifi
Light Fidelity (LiFi) as a sensor.

## Introduction
The LiFi component uses light, largely within line-of-sight, to enable communications without interfering with radio receivers and in spite of radio jamming.
Bandwidth over LiFi can be much higher than radio and the amount of space available for use is far greater.
It requires a light transmitter and light receiver both normally combined into a LiFi transceiver to support two-way communications.
